Using NFL Player Statistics to Predict Game Winners

This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to predict the outcome of NFL games based on historical player and team statistics. We leveraged data from the official NFL website, spanning from 1970 to 2023, and employed data parsing, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling to determine key performance indicators for winning teams. Our approach includes Random Forest Classification models to predict game winners, multiple regression for score differences, and a separate model to identify Super Bowl-winning teams. The findings demonstrate a predictive accuracy significantly above random chance, offering valuable insights for sports analysts and bettors. The project also includes data visualizations and statistical tests to highlight trends and key features contributing to team success.
